# Analysis of Brazilian Championship Games from 2003 to 2022

This data science project uses Python and Streamlit tools to analyze data from Brazilian Championship games between 2003 and 2022. The objective is to extract interesting insights and patterns from the data and present them in an interactive and intuitive way.

## Data

The data used was obtained from the [Kagle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adaoduque/campeonato-brasileiro-de-futebol). This data contains information about games, teams, players, and referees and is provided in CSV format.

## Tools Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Streamlit

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

~~~
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
~~~

2. Install the dependencies

~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

3. Run the application

~~~
streamlit run app.py
~~~

## How to Use
When running the application, you will be directed to an initial page that presents a set of graphs and tables with basic information about the championship, such as the number of games, goals scored, and average goals per game. From there, you can use the filter and selection options available in the sidebar to view specific statistics about teams, players, referees, and matches.

Some of the available visualizations include:

* Team rankings
* Team performance at home and away
* Top scorers of the championship
* Referees with the most games officiated
* Distribution of yellow and red cards
